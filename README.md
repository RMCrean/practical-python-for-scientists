- Course marking is done by 50% attendance, 50% final project.  


### Final Project Assignment

The final project can either be to complete a project in which you apply Python to your own research (encouraged) or in cases where this is not possible, an alternative project will be provided that suits you and your field. If you choose to apply Python to your own research, you can select something that suits you. This could for example be analyzing some newly generated data or automating some data analysis that you previously used excel to do. 

The final project results will be presented as part of a short seminar in 5 weeks time. I want the final projects to be beneficial to you and your research goals so please consider that priority number one when designing the projects. 

We will spend Friday planning out the final project.
