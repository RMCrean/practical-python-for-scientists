Today we went through some useful tools that can help make your coding experience easier. 

We then went through some useful built in tools in Python and "Pythonic" way to handle errors. 

Tomorrow we will make a start on using Git and GitHub. This is a really useful and sort after skill. Further, it is a great way to handle versioning of your projects, work with others and share your research.

### Before we Begin Tomorrow 

- You should have ideally created a GitHub Account, [click here to create one now if not](https://github.com) 

- You can also [setup 2 factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for your GitHub account which is recommended. I like to use the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&pli=1) to do this but there are many other viable options.
