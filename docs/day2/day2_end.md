Today focussed on using Git and GitHub for version control and then how to write cleaner code in Python. 

### Resources for Git and GitHub 

I can very strongly recommend (as I took it a while ago) this [tutorial on Git and GitHub from CodeRefinery.](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/#*) These are run occasionally in Uppsala ([click here](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/) to see upcoming CodeRefinery events). It's much more thorough than what we went through as well.  

This book ([available online and free](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)) is essentially the ultimate resource for Git.
