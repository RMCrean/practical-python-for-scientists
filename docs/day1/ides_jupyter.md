An integrated development enviroment (IDE) is an application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.

For Python, there are 2 very popular IDEs, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (left) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (right).

Both are good choices but for this course we will focus on VSCode.
