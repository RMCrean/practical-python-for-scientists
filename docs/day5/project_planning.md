Today, we can begin preparing for the final project but first we'll start with a Q and A session. 


### Q and A Session
First, we can start with a Q and A session. This is a chance to discuss or go over any of the material so far that you may be unsure about or want to know more about. Questions can be about anything really.

### Final Project Assignment

The final project can either be to complete a project in which you apply Python to your own research (encouraged) or in cases where this is not possible, an alternative project will be provided that suits you and your field. If you choose to apply Python to your own research, you can select something that suits you. This could for example be analyzing some newly generated data or automating some data analysis that you previously used excel to do. 

The final project results will be presented as part of a short seminar in 5 weeks time. I want the final projects to be beneficial to you and your research goals so please consider that priority number one when designing the projects.

### Make a Brief Presentation to Describe your Project

Now we can begin with some project planning for your project. 

It's important to remember this is science and things/ideas/plans change as we go along. It's okay to adapt as you go but an initial plan with some key goals and a general outline of how you will get things done is really valuable in my experience. 

**Consider the following points:**

- Define your project and its goals.  
- What do you need to do achieve those goals.
- Think about your raw data. How will you store it stored? How will you represent the main bits of data in Python (e.g. as DataFrames, dictionaries etc..).  
- How will you present your results, specific figure types you might use. For example, a histogram to show this distribution.  
- Will there be any new techniques that you'll need to learn to analyze it.
- How will your setup your project directory. Folders and layout.

### Exercise: Make a short presentation describing your project

**Things to Include**:

- A basic description of the project and its goals. 
- Define an outline of the steps you'll need to take. 
- One or more parts of the project you are unsure about, or will need to learn more about. 

Try to keep the presentation less than 5 minutes long and focus 

Things your unsure about or help you might need. 

### Bonus/Optional Requirements:
- Use git to track your progress and publish your work on GitHub (you can of course keep the repository private if it should not be shared yet - e.g. work towards a publication)
- Write tests as you go to validate your work.
