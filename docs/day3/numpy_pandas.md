This afternoon session is a self-paced session where you can focus on improving your Pandas and NumPy skills using pre-existing tutorials. 

If you work with data in Python you will likely end up working with both [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) if you haven't already. Below I have provided a list of some suggestions for what you can work on. 


Note: **If you have specific questions or things you want to do then please let me know and we can work on them together.** 


### Pandas Beginner:
