We've now gone through the basics of Git and GitHub. Several topics weren't covered in this session. Including dealing with [merge conflicts](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/conflicts/) and how to [undo things](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things). That said, you should have enough to get started. 

Please see the section "End of Day Overview" for more resources.
