### Understanding Error Messages 

Python traceback. 




### warning vs errors 



### Catching Exceptions
Sometimes an error is not so serious that we want to stop our program. Sometimes an error is completely expected. Consider the following code

```
code that raises a try except error
```

This gives rise to the following error

(referance python ask for forgiveness )


So how do we catch exceptions: 
using a try-except block
```
code that shows an example usage of try except
```

#### Common Mistakes made when doing try except: 


```
try
blank except
```
Bad because even ctrl c wont stop it. 


```
try
except Exception
```
Better but still bad, might catch the wrong thing and you'll never know about it.



### Common use cases for try except:

```
API Calls, requesting service
```
