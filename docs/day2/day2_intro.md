Today will focus on using Git and GitHub for version control and then how to write cleaner code in Python. 


### Before the session on Git and GitHub: 

- You should have ideally created an account on GitHub, [click here to create one now if not](https://github.com) 

- You can also [setup 2 factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for your GitHub account which is recommended. I like to use the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&pli=1) to do this but there are many other viable options.
