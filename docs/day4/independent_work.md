### Topic 1: Design Principles 

Using Design principles help you write more maintainable, flexible, easy-to-read code. 


**Assignment:** Learn about some of the most common design principles present in Python, and how and why you can apply them to your code. 

If you're unsure about where to start, [this article provides a nice overview](https://medium.com/@23saini/design-principles-of-python-851b0dc02d4c).

### Topic 3: Testing code 

Testing code is important to ensure your code behaves as you expect and ensures any future changes to your code don't break it. 

Whilst Python has a built in library for testing Python code named [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), a very popular alternative that I would recommend learning is [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). 

**Assignment:** Learn about how to write basics tests for your code using Pytest. Understand the various types of tests (e.g. unit, integration, end to end) and what edge cases are. Practice implementing some basics tests with pytest on your own code.
